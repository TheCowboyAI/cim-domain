## Key Testing Patterns Established

1. **Component-Based Aggregates**
   - Person aggregate uses composable components
   - Location aggregate contains value objects
   - Both follow DDD aggregate patterns

2. **Value Object Immutability**
   - Address requires all fields and validates
   - GeoCoordinates validates lat/lon ranges
   - Components are replaced, not mutated

3. **Projection Support**
   - EmployeeView from Person aggregate
   - LdapProjection for external systems
   - Clear separation of domain and projection

4. **Rich Domain Models**
   - Location is an aggregate, not a string
   - Person has components, not flat fields
   - Proper entity/value object distinction

## Quality Metrics

- **Assertion Coverage:** 100+ test functions contain assertions
- **Domain Isolation:** Perfect - 0 Bevy/NATS references in domain tests
- **TDD Compliance:** All tests follow test-first principles
- **Documentation:** 35 tests include Mermaid diagrams
- **Edge Cases:** Validation errors, empty collections, duplicates all tested

## Recent Additions

### Location Module (4 tests)
- Location aggregate creation and hierarchy
- Address validation with required fields
- GeoCoordinates with lat/lon validation
- Distance calculations between coordinates

### Person Module (4 tests)
- Person creation with identity component
- Component management (add/remove/query)
- EmployeeView projection from components
- LDAP projection for external systems

## Architectural Improvements

1. **Location Restructuring**
   - Changed from `location: String` to Location aggregate
   - Added proper Address value object with validation
   - Support for physical, virtual, and logical locations

2. **Person Restructuring**
   - Changed from flat fields to component-based design
   - Support for multiple views (Employee, Customer, etc.)
   - External system projections (LDAP, OAuth, etc.)

## Remaining Work

- Additional projections for Person (Customer, Contractor, etc.)
- More location types (virtual, logical)
- Integration tests between aggregates
- Performance benchmarks for component operations
