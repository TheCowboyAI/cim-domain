# Organization Aggregate Implementation Summary

## Overview

The Organization aggregate has been fully implemented in `cim-domain` to support hierarchical organizational structures, member management, and location associations.

## Key Features

### 1. Hierarchical Structure
- Organizations can have parent/child relationships
- Supports organizational units (departments, teams, divisions)
- Prevents circular references
- Tracks both parent and child units

### 2. Member Management
- Add/remove members with specific roles
- Role hierarchy (Executive → Director → Manager → Lead → Senior → Mid → Junior → Intern)
- Reporting relationships (manager assignments)
- Member metadata support

### 3. Location Management
- Primary location designation
- Multiple location associations
- Integration with Location aggregate

### 4. Component-Based Extensibility
- Uses the same component system as Person
- Supports dynamic properties
- Example components:
  - `OrganizationMetadata` (industry, size, website, etc.)
  - `BudgetComponent` (fiscal tracking)

### 5. Organization Types
- Company
- Department
- Team
- Division
- Subsidiary
- NonProfit
- Government
- Partnership
- Custom types

### 6. Organization Status
- Active
- Inactive
- Suspended
- Dissolved

## Domain Events

Following DDD best practices, all events use removal/addition pattern for value objects:

### Core Events
- `OrganizationCreated`
- `OrganizationStatusChanged`

### Member Events
- `OrganizationMemberAdded`
- `OrganizationMemberRemoved`
- `MemberRoleRemoved` + `MemberRoleAssigned` (no "update" events)

### Structure Events
- `OrganizationParentRemoved` + `OrganizationParentSet`
- `OrganizationChildUnitsAdded`
- `OrganizationChildUnitsRemoved`

### Location Events
- `OrganizationLocationsAdded`
- `OrganizationLocationsRemoved`
- `OrganizationPrimaryLocationRemoved` + `OrganizationPrimaryLocationSet`

## Commands

- `CreateOrganization`
- `AddOrganizationMember`
- `UpdateOrganizationStructure`
- `SetOrganizationStatus`
- `AssignOrganizationLocation`

## Usage Example

```rust
// Create organization
let mut org = Organization::new(
    "Acme Corporation",
    OrganizationType::Company,
);

// Add member
org.add_member(person_id, OrganizationRole {
    title: "Software Engineer".to_string(),
    level: RoleLevel::Senior,
    department: Some("Engineering".to_string()),
    is_manager: false,
})?;

// Set reporting relationship
org.set_reports_to(person_id, manager_id)?;

// Add location
org.add_location(location_id)?;
org.set_primary_location(location_id)?;

// Add component
org.add_component(Box::new(BudgetComponent {
    fiscal_year: 2024,
    total_budget: 1_000_000.0,
    currency: "USD".to_string(),
    allocated: 750_000.0,
    spent: 500_000.0,
}));
```

## Integration Points

1. **Person Aggregate**: Members are referenced by person_id
2. **Location Aggregate**: Locations are referenced by location_id
3. **Graph Domain**: Organizations can be nodes in ContextGraph
4. **Event Sourcing**: All changes produce domain events

## Test Coverage

5 comprehensive tests covering:
- Organization creation
- Member management
- Organizational hierarchy
- Location management
- Component system

## Next Steps

1. Implement Agent aggregate (similar pattern)
2. Implement Policy aggregate
3. Add command handlers for actual processing
4. Create integration examples with graph domain
