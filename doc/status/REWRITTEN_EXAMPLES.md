# Rewritten Examples Summary

Date: 2025-01-18

## Overview

All previously disabled examples have been successfully rewritten to work with the current cim-domain API.

### ✅ Completed Examples

1. **event_stream_example.rs**
   - Pure example; no external services
   - Demonstrates publishing domain events
   - Shows loading events from the store
   - Working with event metadata
   - Subscribing to event streams

2. **command_handler_example.rs**
   - Implements commands with the Command trait
   - Creates command envelopes with metadata
   - Shows command validation and acknowledgment
   - Demonstrates correlation and causation IDs
   - Task management example with state transitions

3. **event_replay_example.rs**
   - Replays events from an event store
   - Builds aggregate state from events
   - Custom event handlers for replay
   - Demonstrates partial replay from a specific version
   - Account/transaction example showing state reconstruction

4. **query_handler_example.rs**
   - Demonstrates two query patterns (Direct and CQRS)
   - Direct query handlers that return data
   - CQRS query handlers that return acknowledgments
   - Different query patterns (by ID, search, filter)
   - QueryCriteria for flexible filtering

5. Removed persistence examples (moved to infrastructure crates)
   - Read model storage for queries
   - Aggregate metadata and versioning
   - Batch operations
   - Simple persistence without event sourcing

6. **bevy_integration.rs**
   - Component trait implementation
   - Entity-component architecture
   - Type-safe component storage
   - Bevy-style system patterns
   - Component queries and filtering

7. **workflow_basics.rs**
   - State machines for workflows
   - Moore and Mealy machine patterns
   - State transition validation
   - Workflow implementation patterns
   - Transition history tracking

8. **integration_example.rs**
   - Domain bridges for cross-domain communication
   - Event routing with transformation
   - Service registry pattern
   - Dependency injection container
   - Pattern-based event routing

## Key API Changes Addressed

1. Removed event store demos from this crate (pure library scope)
2. **Event Metadata**: Changed structure with optional fields
3. **Correlation/Causation IDs**: Now use IdType enum wrapper
4. **Event Handler**: Updated trait signature with ReplayStats parameter
5. **Command Acknowledgment**: Changed field names (reason instead of message)
6. **Query Response**: Now returns result as serde_json::Value
7. Persistence moved to infrastructure crates; this library provides domain traits only
8. **Component System**: Uses cim-component re-exported traits
9. **State Machines**: Simplified API without aggregate dependencies
10. **Integration**: Uses public APIs only, avoiding internal types

## Usage

All examples can be run with:

```bash
cargo run --example event_stream_example
cargo run --example command_handler_example  
cargo run --example event_replay_example
cargo run --example query_handler_example
// persistence examples moved downstream
cargo run --example bevy_integration
cargo run --example workflow_basics
cargo run --example integration_example
```

Note: Examples in this crate are pure and require no external services.
```bash
docker run -p 4222:4222 nats:latest -js
```

## Status

✅ All 8 previously disabled examples have been successfully rewritten and are now functional with the current API.
