2. Add metadata to events
3. Update command/query handlers
4. Test state machine transitions

## Known Issues

### Current Limitations

1. **Persistence Layer** - Only simple repository is functional; advanced modules have type dependency issues
2. **No Benchmarks** - Performance characteristics need measurement
3. **No Production Monitoring** - Metrics and observability not yet implemented

### Workarounds

1. Use simple_repository.rs for basic persistence needs while type issues are resolved
2. Leverage NATS JetStream directly for event persistence
3. Use integration layer for cross-domain communication
4. Reference integration_example.rs and simple_persistence_example.rs for usage patterns
5. Monitor NATS metrics for production insights

## Contributing

### Priority Areas

1. **Type Dependency Resolution** - Fix compilation issues in persistence layer
2. **Performance Benchmarks** - Establish baselines and optimize
3. **Production Monitoring** - Metrics, tracing, and observability
4. **Advanced Features** - Mathematical foundations and optimizations

### Guidelines

- Maintain 100% test coverage for new code
- Follow existing patterns and conventions
- Update this status document with changes
- Add examples for new features
