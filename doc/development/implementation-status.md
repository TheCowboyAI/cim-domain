- State machine enhancements
- CQRS pattern updates
- Event metadata additions

Migration steps:
1. Update component trait implementations
2. Add metadata to events
3. Update command/query handlers
4. Test state machine transitions

## Known Issues

### Current Limitations

1. **No Persistent Storage** - All data is in-memory only
2. **No Event Replay** - Cannot rebuild state from events
3. **Limited Integration** - Examples need updating
4. **No Benchmarks** - Performance characteristics unknown

### Workarounds

1. Use InMemoryRepository for testing
2. Implement custom persistence if needed
3. Reference simple_example.rs for basic usage
4. Monitor resource usage in production

## Contributing

### Priority Areas

1. **Event Store Implementation** - Critical for event sourcing
2. **Integration Examples** - Show real-world usage
3. **Performance Benchmarks** - Establish baselines
4. **Documentation** - Improve API docs

### Guidelines

- Maintain 100% test coverage for new code
- Follow existing patterns and conventions
- Update this status document with changes
- Add examples for new features

## Conclusion

The CIM Domain framework has achieved a solid foundation with all core aggregates implemented and comprehensive test coverage. The focus now shifts to:

1. Completing event sourcing infrastructure
2. Adding persistence capabilities
3. Creating production-ready integrations
4. Leveraging mathematical foundations for advanced features

The framework is production-ready for in-memory usage and serves as the foundation for 14+ domain implementations.
