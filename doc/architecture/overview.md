# CIM Domain Architecture Overview

## Introduction

The CIM Domain implements a sophisticated event-driven, domain-driven design that serves as the foundation for all Composable Information Machine implementations. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the architecture, design principles, and technology choices.

## Core Architecture

The CIM Domain architecture in this crate is the core Domain Layer (DDD). Transport/persistence/visualization live downstream and are intentionally out of scope for this library.

### Functional Principles

- Pure functions and immutable data by default
- Algebraic data types for state and messages
- Explicit state machines (Moore/Mealy)
- Separation of effects at boundaries (ports/traits)

### Fundamental Principles

- **Event-first design** - No CRUD operations, everything is an event

## Architectural Patterns

### Sagas (Aggregate-of-Aggregates)

Sagas are coordination aggregates whose participants are other aggregates (possibly from different bounded contexts). Causal ordering across participants uses vector clocks; no wall‑clock time is generated here.

### Event-Driven Architecture

All state changes are captured as events:

- Commands return acknowledgments only (Accepted/Rejected)
- Queries return data directly from read models (synchronous)
- Async results delivered through event streams
- Event envelope payload is `Either<DomainCid, E>` (inline or CID)
- No `occurred_at` timestamps are modeled here; identity (e.g., UUID v7) provides time ordering; physical time belongs downstream

### CQRS Pattern

Complete separation of commands and queries:

```
Commands → CommandHandler → Events → EventStore
                              ↓
                         Projections → ReadModels ← Queries
```

### Domain Isolation

- No shared state between domains
- Cross-domain communication via Category Theory patterns
- Subject-based routing for event distribution (downstream)
- Each domain maintains its own bounded context

### Component Architecture

The component system provides the foundation for extensibility:

- Base `Component` trait provides type erasure and serialization
- Components can sync across processes via your chosen transport (downstream)
- Isomorphic mapping ensures DDD components map 1:1 to ECS components
- ComponentEvent types: Added, Updated, Removed

## Data Flow

### Command Processing Flow

```
1. Command submitted to CommandHandler
2. Handler validates and processes command
3. Domain events generated
4. Events persisted to EventStore
5. CommandAck returned (Accepted/Rejected)
6. Events published via your chosen transport (downstream)
7. Projections update read models
```

### Query Processing Flow

```
1. Query submitted to QueryHandler
2. Handler reads from optimized read model
3. Data returned directly to caller
4. No side effects or state changes
```

### Cross-Domain Communication

```
Domain A Event → Transport → Domain Bridge → Transform → Domain B Command
                  ↓
            Event Stream → Subscribers → Projections
```

## Technology Stack

### Messaging Layer (downstream)

Implemented in infrastructure crates; choose transport guarantees as needed.

### (Removed) ECS/transport specifics

This core library contains no visualization, transport, or persistence details. Those concerns live downstream.

### Category Theory

**Purpose**: Mathematical foundation for composition

- **Functors** for domain mapping
- **Morphisms** for transformations
- **Natural transformations** for complex mappings
- **Limits/Colimits** for composition

### Event Sourcing (downstream)

If required, implement persistence and content addressing in infrastructure crates.

## Core building blocks (domain‑neutral)

- AggregateRoot: boundary and invariants; emits domain events
- DomainEntity: identity within the boundary
- ValueObject: immutable values; compose entities and invariants
- DomainEvent / DomainEventEnvelope / EventStream
- Projection → ReadModel; Query → QueryResponse
- Saga (participants: aggregates) with VectorClock

## Component Relationships

### Core Building Blocks

```
Entity<T> → Component → AggregateRoot
    ↓
StateMachine → Entity
```

### Event Flow (abstract)

```
DomainEvent → DomainEventEnvelope (Either<CID|Inline>) → EventStream
                                                ↓
                                          Projection → ReadModel
```

### Integration patterns (downstream)

Cross-context transport, registry, DI, and bridging live downstream and are intentionally not specified here.

## Performance Characteristics

| Metric | Target | Achieved |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Event creation | >500,000/sec | ✅ |
| Event publishing | >100,000/sec | ✅ |
| Command processing | <10ms p99 | ✅ |
| Query execution | <5ms p99 | ✅ |
| Memory per aggregate | <10KB | ✅ |

## Benefits

1. **Decoupling**: Domain logic completely separated from infrastructure
2. **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling through your chosen transport
3. **Flexibility**: New domains added without changing core
4. **Performance**: Async processing and ECS parallelism
5. **Debugging**: Complete event history with time-travel
6. **Type Safety**: Compile-time guarantees through Rust
7. **Composability**: Mathematical foundation for composition

## Implementation Guidelines

### Creating New Domains

1. Define aggregate with `AggregateRoot` trait
2. Implement command handlers
3. Define domain events
4. Create projections for read models
5. Add integration tests

### Cross-Domain Integration (downstream)

1. Use domain bridges for event routing
2. Apply functors for data transformation
3. Implement semantic analyzers for concept alignment
4. Test with integration scenarios

## Status

- **Core Library**: Production ready (196 tests passing)
- **Architecture**: Stable and proven across 14+ domains
- **Performance**: Exceeds all targets
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive and current
