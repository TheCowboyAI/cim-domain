# CIM Domain Architecture Overview

## Introduction

The CIM Domain implements a sophisticated event-driven, domain-driven design that serves as the foundation for all Composable Information Machine implementations. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the architecture, design principles, and technology choices.

## Core Architecture

The CIM Domain architecture consists of three key layers:

1. **Domain Layer (DDD)** - Business logic and domain modeling
2. **Transport Layer (NATS)** - The ONLY allowed transport between processes
3. **Visualization Layer (Bevy ECS)** - UI and real-time visualization

### Fundamental Principles

- **EVERYTHING runs on ECS** (Bevy Entity Component System)
- **Some things enhance ECS with DDD** patterns
- **1:1 isomorphic mapping** between DDD components and ECS components
- **Event-first design** - No CRUD operations, everything is an event

## Architectural Patterns

### Event-Driven Architecture

All state changes in the system are captured as events:

- Commands return acknowledgments only (Accepted/Rejected)
- Queries return data directly (synchronous)
- Async results delivered through event streams
- Complete event sourcing with time-travel debugging capability
- All events have temporal ordering with `occurred_at` timestamps

### CQRS Pattern

Complete separation of commands and queries:

```
Commands → CommandHandler → Events → EventStore
                              ↓
                         Projections → ReadModels ← Queries
```

### Domain Isolation

- No shared state between domains
- Cross-domain communication via Category Theory patterns
- Subject-based routing for event distribution
- Each domain maintains its own bounded context

### Component Architecture

The component system provides the foundation for extensibility:

- Base `Component` trait provides type erasure and serialization
- Components automatically sync across processes via NATS
- Isomorphic mapping ensures DDD components map 1:1 to ECS components
- ComponentEvent types: Added, Updated, Removed

## Data Flow

### Command Processing Flow

```
1. Command submitted to CommandHandler
2. Handler validates and processes command
3. Domain events generated
4. Events persisted to EventStore
5. CommandAck returned (Accepted/Rejected)
6. Events published to NATS
7. Projections update read models
```

### Query Processing Flow

```
1. Query submitted to QueryHandler
2. Handler reads from optimized read model
3. Data returned directly to caller
4. No side effects or state changes
```

### Cross-Domain Communication

```
Domain A Event → NATS → Domain Bridge → Transform → Domain B Command
                  ↓
            Event Stream → Subscribers → Projections
```

## Technology Stack

### NATS Messaging

**Purpose**: Distributed messaging and component synchronization

- Subject-based routing with wildcards
- Guaranteed delivery with JetStream
- Clustering support for high availability
- Format: `context.entity.event.version`

### Bevy ECS

**Purpose**: High-performance entity component system

- Data-oriented design for cache efficiency
- Parallel processing of systems
- Flexible component composition
- Real-time visualization support

### Category Theory

**Purpose**: Mathematical foundation for composition

- **Functors** for domain mapping
- **Morphisms** for transformations
- **Natural transformations** for complex mappings
- **Limits/Colimits** for composition

### Event Sourcing with CIDs

**Purpose**: Immutable audit trail with cryptographic integrity

- Content-addressed storage using IPLD
- CID chains for event integrity
- Time-travel debugging capability
- Verifiable event history

## Core Domain Aggregates

The system implements 7 essential aggregates:

| Aggregate | Purpose | Key Features |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| Person | Individual users and identities | Identity management, authentication |
| Organization | Groups, companies, collectives | Hierarchical structure, member management |
| Agent | AI and automated entities | Capability boundaries, task execution |
| Location | Physical and logical locations | Address management, geo-coordinates |
| Policy | Rules and governance | Approval workflows, permissions |
| Document | Files and content | Version control, content addressing |
| Workflow | Business processes | State machines, orchestration |

## Component Relationships

### Core Building Blocks

```
Entity<T> → Component → AggregateRoot
    ↓
StateMachine → Entity
```

### Event Flow

```
DomainEvent → EventEnvelope → NATS → EventHandler
                                ↓
                          ProjectionUpdater → ReadModel
```

### Integration Patterns

```
ServiceRegistry → DependencyInjection
       ↓
DomainBridge → CrossDomainRules → SemanticAnalyzer
```

## Performance Characteristics

| Metric | Target | Achieved |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Event creation | >500,000/sec | ✅ |
| Event publishing | >100,000/sec | ✅ |
| Command processing | <10ms p99 | ✅ |
| Query execution | <5ms p99 | ✅ |
| Memory per aggregate | <10KB | ✅ |

## Benefits

1. **Decoupling**: Domain logic completely separated from infrastructure
2. **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling through NATS clustering
3. **Flexibility**: New domains added without changing core
4. **Performance**: Async processing and ECS parallelism
5. **Debugging**: Complete event history with time-travel
6. **Type Safety**: Compile-time guarantees through Rust
7. **Composability**: Mathematical foundation for composition

## Implementation Guidelines

### Creating New Domains

1. Define aggregate with `AggregateRoot` trait
2. Implement command handlers
3. Define domain events
4. Create projections for read models
5. Add integration tests

### Cross-Domain Integration

1. Use domain bridges for event routing
2. Apply functors for data transformation
3. Implement semantic analyzers for concept alignment
4. Test with integration scenarios

## Status

- **Core Library**: Production ready (196 tests passing)
- **Architecture**: Stable and proven across 14+ domains
- **Performance**: Exceeds all targets
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive and current
