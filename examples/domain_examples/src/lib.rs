//! Domain examples and BDD tests exercising cim-domain primitives.
//!
//! This crate is not the core library â€” it depends on `cim-domain` and
//! contains example integration tests and Gherkin-driven scenarios that
//! exercise event streams and ordering for sample aggregates.

// No code is required here; all examples live in `tests/` as integration tests.
